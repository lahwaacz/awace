[Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor](http://ace.c9.io/) brought to the Arch wiki

About
-----

_awace_ is a [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) userscript that replaces the default, simple editor on [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) with a more powerful editor.

__Warning:__ this project is currently just a __proof of concept__, please double-check after each wiki edit that the script did what you expected!
